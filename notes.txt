--initilaise = tsc --init 
compiler- tsc app.ts

automatic compilation = tsc --watch

for declaring variables, dont use "var", it causes weird behavior
use let and const only...

primitive and ref 
ref- {} () [] , ref means b=a means a is like address naki copy
rest are primitive

tuple- just like array, but fixed size and we can also give what ele to
give at what pos 


enum eg=  enum status_codes{
    success=200, 
    notfound=404,
    internalerror=500,
    
}
now we can use above values directly


data types-- 
1. any- default value of a variable
2. unknown- in this we have to check what is type using typeof var_name
3. never- if used with a fnc, it will never return a value, rest code will not return


type inference- tsc will automatically give a datatype
